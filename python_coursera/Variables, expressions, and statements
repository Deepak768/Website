2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25).
You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.




hrs = input("Enter Hours:")  //inputing the hours 
rate= input("enter rate:")   //rate
Pay = float(rate)*float(hrs)  //doing the final calculations
print('Pay:',Pay)  //printing out
